# Quiz-Server-Client

This is uses the python google sheets API to store user scores and leaderboards. This means it has a client_secret.json if you want to run this on your own machine, you will need to provide this file yourself.

There is one client file (main.py) run this to do the quiz.

There is one server file (ServerGui.py) run this to host the leaderboard.
